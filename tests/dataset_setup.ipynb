One occurred around 2015, where the volume peaked above 120M shares.\\nAnother significant spike occurred in 2014, with volume hitting around 80M shares.\\nThese spikes may be associated with significant corporate events, market reactions, or major news related to the airline.\\nDecline Towards 2018:\\n\\nToward 2017 and 2018, the trading volume shows a noticeable decline, with fewer spikes and relatively lower monthly volumes compared to earlier periods.\\nRegular Activity:\\n\\nEven outside the spikes, there is a relatively steady volume between 10M and 20M shares traded monthly, indicating consistent market interest in AAL stock during these years.\\nPotential Analysis Areas:\\n\\nThe spikes in 2014 and 2015 likely reflect impactful news or events like mergers, financial announcements, or broader market volatility affecting the airline industry.\"}]\n",

One occurred around 2015, where the volume peaked above 120M shares.\\nAnother significant spike occurred in 2014, with volume hitting around 80M shares.\\nThese spikes may be associated with significant corporate events, market reactions, or major news related to the airline.\\nDecline Towards 2018:\\n\\nToward 2017 and 2018, the trading volume shows a noticeable decline, with fewer spikes and relatively lower monthly volumes compared to earlier periods.\\nRegular Activity:\\n\\nEven outside the spikes, there is a relatively steady volume between 10M and 20M shares traded monthly, indicating consistent market interest in AAL stock during these years.\\nPotential Analysis Areas:\\n\\nThe spikes in 2014 and 2015 likely reflect impactful news or events like mergers, financial announcements, or broader market volatility affecting the airline industry.\"}]\n",

One occurred around 2015, where the volume peaked above 120M shares.\\nAnother significant spike occurred in 2014, with volume hitting around 80M shares.\\nThese spikes may be associated with significant corporate events, market reactions, or major news related to the airline.\\nDecline Towards 2018:\\n\\nToward 2017 and 2018, the trading volume shows a noticeable decline, with fewer spikes and relatively lower monthly volumes compared to earlier periods.\\nRegular Activity:\\n\\nEven outside the spikes, there is a relatively steady volume between 10M and 20M shares traded monthly, indicating consistent market interest in AAL stock during these years.\\nPotential Analysis Areas:\\n\\nThe spikes in 2014 and 2015 likely reflect impactful news or events like mergers, financial announcements, or broader market volatility affecting the airline industry.\"}]\n",
